# CDE (Custom Desktop Environment)

This project aims to provide a pre-configured set of widgets with a window manager and provide a simple, decent looking desktop UI which is functional right out of box.

#### Target Audience
This is for any person who is like the owner of this project/repo who is 'familiar' with linux, not an expert, not even a mediocre. Just a noob.

## Roadmap

Most of the OSes out there (like Windows, Mac or other Linux distros) have several common components, namely:

- Task/Status bar
- Calendar
- App Drawer/Menu bar
- Notification Panel
- Workspaces

Including other common features/behaviours. This project aims to cover to components and features as much as possible. Check below for what is on the roadmap, what's in-progress and what has been completed. This checklist will be based on RHEL based distros using Wayland.

The list follows the component-behaviour/feature pattern which means that all the expected behaviours listed are categorized by the components they are related with.
